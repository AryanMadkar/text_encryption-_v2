A text encryption and decryption app can have several features to make it secure, user-friendly, and versatile. Here are some commonly included features:

### 1. **Basic Encryption and Decryption**
   - **Text Input**: Users can enter or paste text they wish to encrypt.
   - **Encryption Key**: A required field where users enter a key to encrypt the text. This could be a passphrase, or in more secure apps, it might generate a unique key.
   - **Encrypted Output**: Display the encrypted text, which users can then copy or share.
   - **Decryption**: Users can enter encrypted text and the corresponding key to decrypt and retrieve the original text.

### 2. **File Encryption and Decryption**
   - Support for encrypting and decrypting text files or other file types (e.g., PDFs, images) to expand beyond just text.

### 3. **Key Generation and Management**
   - **Key Generation Tool**: An option to generate secure random keys of different lengths (e.g., 128-bit, 256-bit) to ensure strong encryption.
   - **Key Storage**: Allow users to securely save encryption keys locally or in a secure cloud service.
   - **Password Protection**: An additional password layer for access to saved keys or decrypted text.

### 4. **Different Encryption Algorithms**
   - **Algorithm Selection**: Users can choose between different encryption standards, such as AES-128, AES-256, or RSA.
   - **Algorithm Descriptions**: Basic information on each algorithm's strengths and potential use cases.

### 5. **Encryption Options**
   - **Initialization Vector (IV) Management**: For algorithms requiring an IV, generate it automatically and show the option to reuse or randomize for each encryption.
   - **Salt and Hashing**: Use salt (random data) to enhance security and options for hashing passwords if theyâ€™re used as keys.

### 6. **User Interface for Security and Privacy**
   - **Clipboard Management**: Automatically clears encrypted/decrypted text from the clipboard after a few seconds to protect against clipboard snooping.
   - **Privacy Mode**: Obscure the text input/output fields for sensitive text.
   - **Auto-Clear Functionality**: Automatically clears fields after a specified time to prevent sensitive data from being left on screen.

### 7. **Integration and Export Options**
   - **Shareable Links**: Generate encrypted text as a shareable link that decrypts only with the correct key.
   - **QR Code Generation**: Convert encrypted text into a QR code to scan and share encrypted data more easily.
   - **Import and Export**: Allow importing and exporting encrypted/decrypted text files for easy backup.

### 8. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**
   - **Web and Mobile Access**: Provide mobile or web versions to make the app accessible on different devices.
   - **Offline Functionality**: Allow local encryption and decryption without an internet connection for privacy.

### 9. **Encryption History and Logs**
   - **Encryption Logs**: Maintain a log of encrypted and decrypted texts (without storing the original text), including timestamps.
   - **Bookmarking**: Let users bookmark frequently used keys or encrypted text for easy access.

### 10. **Advanced Security Features**
   - **Two-Factor Authentication**: Require two-factor authentication for accessing saved encrypted data.
   - **Biometric Locking**: Support for biometrics (fingerprint/face) to access the app on mobile devices.
   - **Self-Destruct**: Delete sensitive data after a set number of unsuccessful decryption attempts, useful for highly sensitive text.

### 11. **Additional Utility Features**
   - **Theming**: Offer dark mode/light mode for better usability.
   - **API Integration**: Allow developers to access encryption/decryption functions via a secure API.
   - **Support for Multi-Language**: Add multi-language support for better accessibility.

By combining some of these features, you can create a robust text encryption and decryption app tailored to both casual and security-conscious users.
